## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

To load the dataset in the variable activity

```{r activity}
activity<-read.csv("C:/Users/HP/Downloads/activity.csv")
```

Calculating total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
total<-sum(activity$steps,na.rm=TRUE)
total
```

Forming histogram for total numbers of steps taken per day

```{r}
total_step<-aggregate(steps~date, data=activity, FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
hist(total_step$steps)
```

Calculating mean and median
```{r}
m1<-mean(total_step$steps)
m2<-median(total_step$steps)
```

Making a time series plot for 5 min intervals
```{r}
p1<-aggregate(steps~interval,data = activity,FUN=mean,na.rm=TRUE)
plot(x=p1$interval,y=p1$steps,type="l")
```

Counting max step 5 min interval
```{r}
max_steps <- max(p1$steps)
for (i in 1:288) 
{
    if (p1$steps[i] == max_steps)
        p2 <- p1$interval[i]
}
p2
```

Counting total number missing value
```{r}
total_na <- 0
for (i in 1:17568)
{
    if(is.na(activity$steps[i])) 
        total_na <- total_na+1 
}
total_na
```

New data set having no missing values
```{r}
activity_filled_in <- activity
for (i in 1:17568) 
{
    if(is.na(activity_filled_in$steps[i])) 
    { 
        five_minute_pointer <- activity_filled_in$interval[i] 
        for (j in 1:288) 
        {
            if (p1$interval[j] == five_minute_pointer)
                activity_filled_in$steps[i] <- p1$steps[j]
        }
    }
}
```

Histogram of total steps each day taken
```{r}
a1 <- aggregate(steps~date, data=activity_filled_in, FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)

hist(a1$steps)
```

Finding difference at weekends and weekdays
```{r}
meanweek <- mean(a1$steps)
medweek <- median(a1$steps)
```

Finding pattern
```{r}
library(lubridate)
week <- wday(activity_filled_in$date)
week_day <- week
for (i in 1:17568) 
{
    if(week[i] == 1)
        week_day[i] <- 'weekend'
    if(week[i] == 2)
        week_day[i] <- 'weekday'
    if(week[i] == 3)
        week_day[i] <- 'weekday'
    if(week[i] == 4)
        week_day[i] <- 'weekday'
    if(week[i] == 5)
        week_day[i] <- 'weekday'
    if(week[i] == 6)
        week_day[i] <- 'weekday'
    if(week[i] == 7)
        week_day[i] <- 'weekend'
}

activity_filled_in$weekday <-week_day
```


Making a plot for it
```{r}
weekday <- grep("weekday",activity_filled_in$weekday)
weekday_frame <- activity_filled_in[weekday,]
weekend_frame <- activity_filled_in[-weekday,]


five_minutes_average_weekday <- aggregate(steps~interval, data=weekday_frame, FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
five_minutes_average_weekend <- aggregate(steps~interval, data=weekend_frame, FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)

plot(x = five_minutes_average_weekday$interval, y = five_minutes_average_weekday$steps, type = "l")
```

```{r}
plot(x = five_minutes_average_weekend$interval, y = five_minutes_average_weekend$steps, type = "l") 
```
